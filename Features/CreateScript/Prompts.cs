                Pre-Script Requirements:

                First, create your video packaging:

                Working Title: [Create 5-10 title variations, pick the most compelling]
                Thumbnail Concept: [Describe what viewers will see]
                Three Key Questions: What are the 3 main questions viewers clicking this title/thumbnail want answered?

                Script Structure Framework:
                1. HOOK (First 15-30 seconds) - CRITICAL
                Choose one hook type and execute it powerfully:

                Question Hook: Start with a compelling ""why"" question that creates pattern interruption
                Context Hook: Drop viewers into the highest-stakes moment of your story
                Statement Hook: Make a bold/controversial claim that shocks but you can back up

                Your hook must:

                Match the title/thumbnail expectations
                Promise clear value
                Create immediate tension/curiosity
                Avoid ""Hey guys, welcome back"" introductions

                2. INTRO (15-45 seconds)

                Three-Point Preview: Address the 3 key questions from your packaging
                Exceed Expectations: Add something extra (free resource, surprising depth, unique angle)
                Credibility Statement: Briefly explain why you're qualified to discuss this (experience, struggle-to-success story, credentials)
                Soft CTA: Quick mention to like/comment if it helps the algorithm

                3. MAIN CONTENT (Build to Climax)
                Structure your points using these techniques:
                For Each Main Point:

                Start with a mini-hook/question for that section
                Tell a story that builds to the answer
                Put the PAYOUT at the END of each point (not the beginning)
                Use story delaying - don't give away the answer immediately
                Layer information to create constant curiosity

                Pacing Techniques:

                Open loops that must be closed later
                Create emotional variety (fear → relief, confusion → clarity)
                Use the ""Facts, Feelings, Fun"" formula:

                Facts: Clear, educational information
                Feelings: Personal stories and emotional connection
                Fun: Humor, energy, creative visuals

                Cut 10-20% - every sentence must build toward your climax

                4. OUTRO & CTA (15-30 seconds MAX)

                Maintain high energy - no wind down
                Use the ""Relink Hack"": Hook them into your next video
                Example: ""But everything I just told you is useless if you don't know [RELATED TOPIC]. Check out this video where I break down...""
                Make the next video feel essential, not optional

                Writing Guidelines:

                Write conversational prose, not lists (unless specifically needed)
                Be a guide sharing your journey, not a guru preaching
                Create tension through incomplete thoughts and delayed payoffs
                Each section should make viewers think ""I need to know what happens next""
                Show personality - this isn't a Wikipedia article

                The Build + Tension Formula:
                Every element should either:

                Build toward your one killer point/climax
                Create tension that keeps viewers watching

                If it doesn't do either, cut it.

                Script Stats Requirements:
                At the end of your script, include:
                SCRIPT STATS:

                Hook Type Used: [Question/Context/Statement]
                Main Tension Techniques:

                Climax/Resolution: [X%]

                Payout Placement: [Confirm all payouts at END of sections]
                CTA Type: [Relink to specific video/Soft subscribe/etc.]
